## Build Overview (What do I need to make one?)

I printed the entire shell, hinges, etc., in **Bambu Lab Matte PLA** (though any PLA should work, build quality feel may vary).

- **Mainboards:** RP2040—**integrated directly onto the left custom PCB.** The right side is connnected by ribbon cable.
- **Switches:** Must be **low profile switches.** I use pretty much any Kailh Choc Low Profile switches. They all work, just choose a preferred switch type.
- **USB-C Connector:** [Quark's](https://github.com/quark-works) and Rana Labs' [QuRB](https://github.com/rana-sylvatica/rana-tadpole/tree/main/PCBs/Breakout%20Board%20(QuRB)), a USB C Breakout board with a ribbon cable port, for solderless assembly.
- **Hardware:** M2 screws and M3 screws are the only fasteners required to assemble. You will need **ten M3 heat inserts** for the backplates, **twelve M3 x 5/6mm bolts** for the backplates and QuRB, and **eight M2 x 4mm bolts** to secure each half of the mainboards.

## Assembly

### PCB

To streamline your build, I’ve designed a custom PCB for this controller. This board integrates the Pico directly eliminating the need for any handwiring of the microcontroller. The **only soldering required is the installation of the hotswap sockets for the Choc switches.**

The two halves of the board are connected using a 20 pin, .5 pitch ribbon cable, and the QuRB is connected to the Left side board for USB C port via a 12 pin, .5 pitch ribbon cable.

## Magnets

Strong magnets are crucial, as they must counteract every spring in your switches. I used:

- **6x3mm Neodymium magnets**, stacked **2 high** in each of the **10 total holes** (20 magnets overall).
- This setup creates a satisfying snap and keeps the Moth securely folded.

**Amazon link:** [Magnets used](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096LZNZTQ?ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_ZEAK3BD945P57Y9BB6P4&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_ZEAK3BD945P57Y9BB6P4&social_share=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_ZEAK3BD945P57Y9BB6P4&skipTwisterOG=1&newOGT=1&th=1)

## 'Prism' Ergonomic Mode

For the reverse folded position:

- A **lip** on the two hinge pieces prevents overfolding by creating a defined stopping point.
- The rounded back of the hinges generates friction, ensuring rigidity in the ergonomic 'prism' configuration.

### Adjustments:

- The hinge lip’s width can be edited to modify the folding angle.

## Miscellaneous Notes

- **Button Fit:** Ensure buttons sit flush with the face surface when pressed to allow proper folding.
- **Magnet Strength:** Although strong neodymium magnets can overcome minor misalignments, aim for a flush fit.
- **Hinge Pin Slot:** While you can add caps for a cleaner look, the friction fit alone holds securely.
